# ðŸ“Š Tokenomics

### $SOLFI
$SOLFI has a dynamic supply that is programmed to decrease overtime. Printing more $SOLFI becomes more difficult and expensive as time goes on. This reduces supply and increases the token value.

### Initial Token Distribution

70% Community - The large majority of initial supply will be distributed to OG holders who prepurchased tokens on launch.

20% Liquidity Pool - An initial liquidity pool will be created by founders to establish liquidity for trading $SOLFI after launch.

10% Airdrop - A 10% token supply airdrop will be distributed to SOL community members holding various other top projects, NFTs, and developers.
