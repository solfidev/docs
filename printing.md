# ðŸ’¸ Printing

### What is Printing?
$SOLFI printing is exactly what it sounds like, printing more $SOLFI _*brrrrrrrrrrr*_.

Here's how it works:

1. Deposit SOL _(start by selecting the amount of SOL you wish to deposit.)_
2. Chose your duration _(select the duration you want to commit to printing $SOLFI.)_
3. Earn $SOLFI _(At the end of your timeframe you receive your freshly printed $SOLFI tokens. The more SOL and longer duration you select, the more $SOLFI you can print.)_

### Earlier the better
Each day the amount of $SOLFI that can be printed decreases, similar to Bitcoin mining rewards halving. Meaning that as time goes by you will need more SOL and a longer duration to earn the same amount of $SOLFI as in the good old days. This approach encourages early participation and maintains a strong value of $SOLFI in the longterm.

### How do you earn?
Your potential earnings (APY) is estimated on the main app. Our strategic ecosystem of products are aimed to increase the value of $SOLFI overtime with deflationary mechanism, decreasing rewards, staking, and many other utilities which can lead to a higher return for you. However your exact return will change based on market conditions. This means your rewards can increase or decrease in value over time. 

### What happens to your SOL?
SOL deposited for printing $SOLFI is strategically spread across the growing SolFi ecosystem to promote token growth and encourage users to hold. All which is covered in the docs: [Burning](#burning.md), [Buyback (Buy + Burn)](#buyback.md), [Dividends](#dividends.md), [Reserve](#Reserve)
