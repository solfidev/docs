# üè¶ Reserve

### Introduction to the Reserve Fund
The reserve is a key component of the $SOLFI ecosystem. It's designed to maintain stability and stimulate growth during periods of slowed activity or market downturns. It is a locked stockpile of SOL üí∞

### Where does the SOL come from?
Initially the fund is created by deposits from founding members of the team. After the platform is launched, 10% of SOL from printing is extracted and placed in the reserve fund.

### Are there any benefits or rewards to users who want to contribute to the Reserve?
Yes - however this is still in development. More information will be available in the future.

### Stimulate printing during slowed activity
If SolFi experiences slowed growth or extended periods of inactivity the reserve is utilized to invigorate the ecosystem. By injecting SOL into the printing mechanism (without actually printing more $SOLFI) we can directly enhance rewards for staking and boost other product offerings. This strategic stimulation helps attract new users as APY for printing will be more lucrative and reengage existing ones.

### Drive natural growth
The activation of the reserve is intended to create a ripple effect, leading to natural growth. As new users are drawn in and activity increases, the need for reserve decreases, allowing the fund to be replenished gradually by new users printing $SOLFI.
